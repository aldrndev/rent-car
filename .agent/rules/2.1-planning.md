# 2.1 — Planning & PRD

## Purpose

Define how every project MUST start: with clear requirements and a plan. No coding before planning. This applies whether the project is a weekend MVP or a full production system.

## Planning Flow (ABSOLUTE)

```
Requirements → PRD → Technical Plan → Implementation → Review
```

AI MUST NOT skip to implementation without completing at minimum a lightweight PRD.

## PRD Template

Every project MUST have a PRD document (can be in README or separate `docs/prd.md`):

### 🟢 Lightweight PRD (Small Projects)

```markdown
# Project: [Name]

## Overview
[1-2 sentences: what this project does and for whom]

## Core Features
- [ ] Feature 1 — [brief description]
- [ ] Feature 2 — [brief description]
- [ ] Feature 3 — [brief description]

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: [framework]
- Backend: [framework or Supabase]
- Database: [provider]
- Deployment: [platform]

## Out of Scope
- [What this project does NOT do]

## Success Criteria
- [How do we know it works?]
```

### 🟡 Full PRD (Mid-Size+ Projects)

Extends lightweight PRD with:

```markdown
## User Roles
- [Role 1]: [permissions / capabilities]
- [Role 2]: [permissions / capabilities]

## User Stories
- As a [role], I want to [action] so that [benefit]

## Data Model (High-Level)
- [Entity 1]: [key fields]
- [Entity 2]: [key fields]
- [Relationships]

## API Endpoints (High-Level)
- `POST /api/v1/resource` — [description]
- `GET /api/v1/resource/:id` — [description]

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: [targets]
- Security: [requirements]
- Availability: [requirements]

## Milestones
- [ ] Phase 1: [scope] — [deadline]
- [ ] Phase 2: [scope] — [deadline]

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: [description] → Mitigation: [approach]
```

## Scope Definition Rules (ABSOLUTE)

- Features MUST be explicitly listed — no implied features
- "Out of Scope" section REQUIRED — prevents scope creep
- Every feature MUST have acceptance criteria (even informal ones)
- If the client hasn't defined requirements → AI MUST ask before building

## Estimation Rules (AUTHORITATIVE)

- Break features into tasks of MAX 4 hours each
- If a task can't be estimated → it needs further breakdown
- Add 30% buffer for integration, testing, and edge cases
- Track assumptions — incorrect assumptions invalidate estimates

## Requirement Clarity Check

Before coding, verify:

- [ ] Target users defined
- [ ] Core features listed with acceptance criteria
- [ ] Tech stack decided
- [ ] Data model sketched (at least entities + relationships)
- [ ] Deployment target known
- [ ] Authentication method decided (if applicable)
- [ ] Third-party integrations listed (if any)

If any item is missing → ask the client/user before proceeding.

## Change Management

- New requirements during development MUST be documented
- Scope changes MUST be acknowledged (not silently absorbed)
- If a change affects timeline → communicate immediately
